# RPC API Specification

Version: 7.9.x

**Note:** This document assumes the reader is familiar with gRPC concepts.
Refer to the [gRPC Concepts documentation](https://www.grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html)
for any unfamiliar terms.

**Note:** The naming style used for autogenerated identifiers may differ
depending on the language being used.  This document follows the naming style
used by Google in their Protocol Buffers and gRPC documentation as well as this
project's `.proto` files.  That is, CamelCase is used for services, methods, and
messages, lower_snake_case for message fields, and SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for
enums.

This document is the authoritative source on the RPC API's definitions and
semantics.  Any divergence from this document is an implementation error.  API
fixes and additions require a version increase according to the rules of
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/).

Only optional proto3 message fields are used (the `required` keyword is never
used in the `.proto` file).  If a message field must be set to something other
than the default value, or any other values are invalid, the error must occur in
the application's message handling.  This prevents accidentally introducing
parsing errors if a previously optional field is missing or a new required field
is added.

Functionality is grouped into gRPC services.  Depending on what functions are
currently callable, different services will be running.  As an example, the
server may be running without a loaded wallet, in which case the Wallet service
is not running and the Loader service must be used to create a new or load an
existing wallet.

## `VersionService`

The `VersionService` service provides the caller with versioning information
regarding the RPC server.  It has no dependencies and is always running.

**Methods:**

- [`Version`](#version)

### Methods

#### `Version`

The `Version` method returns the RPC server version.  Versioning follows the
rules of Semantic Versioning (SemVer) 2.0.0.

**Request:** `VersionRequest`

**Response:** `VersionResponse`

- `string version_string`: The version encoded as a string.

- `uint32 major`: The SemVer major version number.

- `uint32 minor`: The SemVer minor version number.

- `uint32 patch`: The SemVer patch version number.

- `string prerelease`: The SemVer pre-release version identifier, if any.

- `string build_metadata`: Extra SemVer build metadata, if any.

**Expected errors:** None

**Stability:** Stable: This service will never introduce a breaking change even
  in future major versions of the API.  It is suitable and recommended to use as
  a runtime compatibility check.

## `WalletLoaderService`

The `WalletLoaderService` service provides the caller with functions related to
the management of the wallet and its connection to the Decred network.  It has
no dependencies and is always running.

**Methods:**

- [`WalletExists`](#walletexists)
- [`CreateWallet`](#createwallet)
- [`CreateWatchingOnlyWallet`](#createwatchingonlywallet)
- [`OpenWallet`](#openwallet)
- [`CloseWallet`](#closewallet)
- [`RescanPoint`](#rescanpoint)
- [`SpvSync`](#spvsync)
- [`RpcSync`](#rpcsync)

**Shared messages:**

- [`BlockDetails`](#blockdetails)
- [`DetachedBlockDetails`](#detachedblockdetails)
- [`TransactionDetails`](#transactiondetails)
- [`DecodedTransaction`](#decodedtransaction)

### Methods

#### `WalletExists`

The `WalletExists` method returns whether a file at the wallet database's file
path exists.  Clients that must load wallets with this service are expected to
call this RPC to query whether `OpenWallet` should be used to open an existing
wallet, or `CreateWallet` to create a new wallet.

**Request:** `WalletExistsRequest`

**Response:** `WalletExistsResponse`

- `bool exists`: Whether the wallet file exists.

**Expected errors:** None

___

#### `CreateWallet`

The `CreateWallet` method is used to create a wallet that is protected by two
levels of encryption: the public passphrase (for data that is made public on the
blockchain) and the private passphrase (for private keys).  Since the seed is
not saved in the wallet database and clients should make their users backup the
seed, it needs to be passed as part of the request.

After creating a wallet, the `WalletService` service begins running.

Since API version 3.0.0, creating the wallet no longer automatically
synchronizes the wallet to the consensus server if it was previously loaded.

**Request:** `CreateWalletRequest`

- `bytes public_passphrase`: The passphrase used for the outer wallet
  encryption.  This passphrase protects data that is made public on the
  blockchain.  If this passphrase has zero length, an insecure default is used
  instead.

- `bytes private_passphrase`: The passphrase used for the inner wallet
  encryption.  This is the passphrase used for data that must always remain
  private, such as private keys.  The length of this field must not be zero.

- `bytes seed`: The BIP0032 seed used to derive all wallet keys.  The length of
  this field must be between 16 and 64 bytes, inclusive.

**Response:** `CreateWalletReponse`

**Expected errors:**

- `FailedPrecondition`: The wallet is currently open.

- `AlreadyExists`: A file already exists at the wallet database file path.

- `InvalidArgument`: A private passphrase was not included in the request, or
  the seed is of incorrect length.

___

#### `CreateWatchingOnlyWallet`

The `CreateWatchingOnlyWallet` method is used to create a watching only wallet.
After creating a wallet, the `WalletService` service begins running.

**Request:** `CreateWatchingOnlyWalletRequest`

- `string extended_public_key`: The extended public key of the wallet.

- `bytes public_passphrase`: The passphrase used for the outer wallet
  encryption.  This passphrase protects data that is made public on the
  blockchain.  If this passphrase has zero length, an insecure default is used
  instead.

**Response:** `CreateWatchingOnlyWalletReponse`

**Expected errors:**

- `FailedPrecondition`: The wallet is currently open.

- `AlreadyExists`: A file already exists at the wallet database file path.

___

#### `OpenWallet`

The `OpenWallet` method is used to open an existing wallet database.  If the
wallet is protected by a public passphrase, it can not be successfully opened if
the public passphrase parameter is missing or incorrect.

After opening a wallet, the `WalletService` service begins running.

Since API version 3.0.0, creating the wallet no longer automatically
synchronizes the wallet to the consensus server if it was previously loaded.

**Request:** `OpenWalletRequest`

- `bytes public_passphrase`: The passphrase used for the outer wallet
  encryption.  This passphrase protects data that is made public on the
  blockchain.  If this passphrase has zero length, an insecure default is used
  instead.

**Response:** `OpenWalletResponse`

**Expected errors:**

- `FailedPrecondition`: The wallet is currently open.

- `NotFound`: The wallet database file does not exist.

- `InvalidArgument`: The public encryption passphrase was missing or incorrect.

___

#### `CloseWallet`

The `CloseWallet` method is used to cleanly stop all wallet operations on a
loaded wallet and close the database.  After closing, the `WalletService`
service will remain running but any operations that require the database will be
unusable.

**Request:** `CloseWalletRequest`

**Response:** `CloseWalletResponse`

**Expected errors:**

- `FailedPrecondition`: The wallet is not currently open.

___

#### `RescanPoint`

The `RescanPoint` returns the block hash at which a rescan should begin
(inclusive), or null when no rescan is necessary.  A non-null rescan point
indicates that blocks currently in the main chain must be checked for address
usage and relevant transactions.

**Request:** `RescanPointRequest`

**Response:** `RescanPointResponse`

- `bytes rescan_point`: The current hash of the rescan point.

**Expected Errors:**

- `FailedPrecondition`: The wallet or consensus RPC server has not been opened.

___

#### `SpvSync`

The `SpvSync` method begins the spv syncing process.  It will
stream back progress to provide feedback on the current state of the wallet
loading/bringup.  This is a long lived RPC and only end when canceled
or upon received an error.

**Request:** `SpvSyncRequest`

- `bool discover_accounts`:  Whether or not the wallet should attempt to
  discover accounts during discovery.  This requires the private passphrase to
  be set as well and will error otherwise.

- `bytes private_passphrase`: The current private passphrase for the wallet.
  This is only required if discover_accounts is set to true and will error
  otherwise.

- `repeated string spv_connect`: When given a list of addresses, the wallet in
  spv mode will no longer attempt to use DNS address discovery to seek out other
  persistent peers and instead use the ones specified here as persistent peers.

**Response:** `stream SpvSyncResponse`

- `bool synced`: This streamed update response denotes whether the wallet is
  synced or not.

- `SyncNotificationType notification_type`: This denotes what type of
  notification has been sent by the wallet.

- `FetchHeadersNotification fetch_headers`: This contains all the information
  for a fetch headers notification response.  In any other case it will be 
  set to nil.

- `FetchMissingCFiltersNotification fetch_missing_cfilters`: This contains all
  the information for a fetch missing cfilters notification response.  In any
  other case it will be set to nil.

- `RescanProgressNotifiction rescan_progress`: This contains all the information
  for a rescan progress notification.  In any other case it will be set to nil.

- `PeerNotification peer_information`: This contains information about the
  current state of the wallet's peers.

**Expected Errors:**

- `FailedPrecondition`: The wallet or consensus RPC server has not been opened.
  The private passphrase does not successfully unlock the wallet.  The string
  provided to spv_connect is not a valid address or port.

- `InvalidArgument`: The private passphrase is incorrect.

___

#### `RpcSync`

The `RpcSync` method begins the syncing process via rpc connection to a daemon. 
It will stream back progress to provide feedback on the current state of the
wallet loading/bringup.  This is a long lived RPC and only end when canceled
or upon received an error.

**Request:** `RpcSyncRequest`

- `string network_address`: The host/IP and optional port of the RPC server to
  connect to.  IP addresses may be IPv4 or IPv6.  If the port is missing, a
  default port is chosen corresponding to the default dcrd RPC port of the
  active Decred network.

- `string username`: The RPC username required to authenticate to the RPC
  server.

- `bytes password`: The RPC password required to authenticate to the RPC server.

- `bytes certificate`: The consensus RPC server's TLS certificate.  If this
  field has zero length and the network address describes a loopback connection
  (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`) TLS will be disabled.

- `bool discover_accounts`:  Whether or not the wallet should attempt to
  discover accounts during discovery.  This requires the private passphrase to
  be set as well and will error otherwise.

- `bytes private_passphrase`: The current private passphrase for the wallet.
  This is only required if discover_accounts is set to true and will error
  otherwise.

- `repeated string spv_connect`: When given a list of addresses, the wallet in
  spv mode will no longer attempt to use DNS address discovery to seek out other
  persistent peers and instead use the ones specified here as persistent peers.

**Response:** `stream RpcSyncResponse`

- `bool synced`: This streamed update response denotes whether the wallet is
  synced or not.

- `SyncNotificationType notification_type`: This denotes what type of
  notification has been sent by the wallet.

- `FetchHeadersNotification fetch_headers`: This contains all the information
  for a fetch headers notification response.  In any other case it will be 
  set to nil.

- `FetchMissingCFiltersNotification fetch_missing_cfilters`: This contains all
  the information for a fetch missing cfilters notification response.  In any
  other case it will be set to nil.

- `RescanProgressNotifiction rescan_progress`: This contains all the information
  for a rescan progress notification.  In any other case it will be set to nil.

- `SyncingStatus syncing_status`: Various properties to describe the current
  state of syncing the wallet is currently performing.  Once synced, this will
  be set to nil.

**Expected Errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: The network address is ill-formatted or does not contain a
  valid IP address.
  
- `InvalidArgument`: The private passphrase is not supplied, but discoveraccounts
  is requested. 

- `InvalidArgument`: The username, password, or certificate are invalid.  This
  condition may not be return `Unauthenticated` as that refers to the client not
  having the credentials to call this method.

- `Unavailable`: The consensus RPC server is unreachable.

- `FailedPrecondition`: A consensus RPC client is already active.

- `FailedPrecondition`: The wallet or consensus RPC server has not been opened.

- `FailedPrecondition`: The private passphrase does not successfully unlock the
  wallet.

  the main chain.  If the transaction was mined in a stake-invalidated block and
  pushed back to mempool to be mined again, or was mined again after being stake
  invalidated, the latest number of confirmations is used (not the confirmations
  of an invalidated block).

- `bytes block_hash`: The block hash the transaction is most recently mined in,
  or null if unmined.

**Expected errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: The transaction hash is of incorrect length.

- `Aborted`: The wallet database is closed.

- `NotFound`: The transaction is not recorded by the wallet.

___

#### `GetTransactions`

The `GetTransactions` method queries the wallet for relevant transactions.  The
query set may be specified using a block range, inclusive, with the heights or
hashes of the minimum and maximum block.  Transaction results are grouped
by the block they are mined in, or grouped together with other unmined
transactions.

To avoid exceeding the maximum message size with the return result, a stream is
used to break up the response into several messages.  A single message will have
results of a single block and no unmined transactions, or only unmined
transactions (and no mined transactions).

**Request:** `GetTransactionsRequest`

- `bytes starting_block_hash`: The block hash of the block to begin including
  transactions from.  If this field is set to the default, the
  `starting_block_height` field is used instead.  If changed, the byte array
  must have length 32 and `starting_block_height` must be zero.

- `sint32 starting_block_height`: The block height to begin including
  transactions from.  If this field is non-zero, `starting_block_hash` must be
  set to its default value to avoid ambiguity.  If positive, the field is
  interpreted as a block height.  If negative, the height is subtracted from the
  block wallet considers itself in sync with.

- `bytes ending_block_hash`: The block hash of the last block to include
  transactions from.  If this default is set to the default, the
  `ending_block_height` field is used instead.  If changed, the byte array must
  have length 32 and `ending_block_height` must be zero.

- `int32 ending_block_height`: The block height of the last block to include
  transactions from.  If non-zero, the `ending_block_hash` field must be set to
  its default value to avoid ambiguity.  If both this field and
  `ending_block_hash` are set to their default values, no upper block limit is
  used and transactions through the best block and all unmined transactions are
  included.

- `int32 target_transaction_count`: Try to return at most this amount of
  transactions. Both mined and unmined transactions count towards this limit.
  Note that as transactions are returned on a per-block basis, **more** than
  this amount of transactions may be returned in total, to prevent transactions
  from not being seen. The caller is responsible for further clipping of the
  dataset if it has a hard requirement on the number of total transactions it
  manages.

**Response:** `stream GetTransactionsResponse`

- `BlockDetails mined_transactions`: All mined transactions, organized
  by blocks in the order they appear in the blockchain.

  The `BlockDetails` message is used by other methods and is documented
  [here](#blockdetails).

- `repeated TransactionDetails unmined_transactions`: All unmined transactions.
  The ordering is unspecified.

  The `TransactionDetails` message is used by other methods and is documented
  [here](#transactiondetails).

**Expected errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: A non-default block hash field did not have the correct length.

- `Aborted`: The wallet database is closed.

- `NotFound`: A block, specified by its height or hash, is unknown to the
  wallet.

**Response:** `GetTicketsResponse`

Refer to [GetTickets](#gettickets) response documentation.

**Expected errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: The ticket hash field did not have the correct length.

- `NotFound`: The specified transaction is not known by the wallet. 
___

#### `GetTickets`

The `GetTickets` method queries the wallet for relevant tickets.  The
query set may be specified using a block range, inclusive, with the heights or
hashes of the minimum and maximum block.

To avoid exceeding the maximum message size with the return result, a stream is
used to break up the response into several messages.  A single message will have
results of a single ticket.

**Request:** `GetTicketsRequest`

- `bytes starting_block_hash`: The block hash of the block to begin including
  tickets from.  If this field is set to the default, the
  `starting_block_height` field is used instead.  If changed, the byte array
  must have length 32 and `starting_block_height` must be zero.

- `sint32 starting_block_height`: The block height to begin including
  tickets from.  If this field is non-zero, `starting_block_hash` must be
  set to its default value to avoid ambiguity.  If positive, the field is
  interpreted as a block height.  If negative, the height is subtracted from the
  block wallet considers itself in sync with.

- `bytes ending_block_hash`: The block hash of the last block to include
  tickets from.  If this default is set to the default, the
  `ending_block_height` field is used instead.  If changed, the byte array must
  have length 32 and `ending_block_height` must be zero.

- `int32 ending_block_height`: The block height of the last block to include
  tickets from.  If non-zero, the `ending_block_hash` field must be set to
  its default value to avoid ambiguity.  If both this field and
  `ending_block_hash` are set to their default values, no upper block limit is
  used and transactions through the best block and all unmined transactions are
  included.

- `int32 target_ticket_count`: Try to return at most this amount of tickets.
  Both mined and unmined tickets count towards this limit. Note that the number
  of tickets returned may be higher or lower than this specified target and
  callers are responsible for further clipping of the dataset if required.

**Response:** `stream GetTicketsResponse`

- `TicketDetails tickets`: A given ticket's details.

  **Nested Message** `TicketDetails`

  - `TransactionDetails ticket`: The transaction details of a given ticket.

  - `TransactionDetails spender`: The transaction details of the ticket's

  transactions.  When relevant transactions are reorganized out and not included
  in (or double-spent by) the new chain, they are included here.

  The `TransactionDetails` message is used by other methods and is documented
  [here](#transactiondetails).

- `repeated bytes unmined_transaction_hashes`: The hashes of every
  currently-unmined transaction.  This differs from the `unmined_transactions`
  field by including every unmined transaction, rather than those newly added to
  the unmined set.

each watched transaction.  A response is immediately streamed that includes the
current number of confirmations for all newly-watched transactions.  Further
responses will continue to describe the number of confirmations of each
transaction until the confirmation upper limit is met or the transaction is
removed from the wallet (e.g. due to a double spend).

**Request:** `stream ConfirmationNotificationsRequest`

- `repeated bytes tx_hashes`: Hashes of transactions to begin watching.

- `int32 stop_after`: The upper limit on how many confirmations is needed before
  the transaction becomes unwatched.

#### `GetCFilters`

The `GetCFilters` method allows callers to fetch the V2 committed filters from
the wallet database. Callers can query these filters to search for the presence
(as spends or new outputs) of arbitrary scripts in blocks.

Only blocks from the current mainchain (from the wallet's point of view) can be
queried. The available filters have already been verified against the header
following DCP0005 activation and are therefore safe for use.


**Request:** `GetCFiltersRequest`

- `bytes starting_block_hash`: The block hash of the block to begin including
  cfilters from.  If this field is set to the default, the
  `starting_block_height` field is used instead.  If changed, the byte array
  must have length 32 and `starting_block_height` must be zero.

- `sint32 starting_block_height`: The block height to begin including
  cfilters from.  If this field is non-zero, `starting_block_hash` must be
  set to its default value to avoid ambiguity.  If positive, the field is
  interpreted as a block height.  If negative, the height is subtracted from the
  block wallet considers itself in sync with.

- `bytes ending_block_hash`: The block hash of the last block to return
  cfilters from.  If this default is set to the default, the
  `ending_block_height` field is used instead.  If changed, the byte array must
  have length 32 and `ending_block_height` must be zero.

- `int32 ending_block_height`: The block height of the last block to return
  cfilters from.  If non-zero, the `ending_block_hash` field must be set to
  its default value to avoid ambiguity.  If both this field and
  `ending_block_hash` are set to their default values, no upper block limit is
  used and cfilters through the best block are returned.


**Response:** `stream GetCFiltersResponse`

Each returned element of the stream corresponds to a single cfilter. The
returned fields for each element are:

- `bytes key`: A byte array with the key that must be used to query the filter.
  This byte array will be of length 16.

- `bytes filter`: The serialized, version 2 committed filter.

- `bytes block_hash`: The block hash of the corresponding block.

## `MessageVerificationService`

The `MessageVerificationService` service provides the caller with the ability to
verify that a message was signed using the private key of a particular address.

**Methods:**

- [`VerifyMessage`](#verifymessage)

### Methods

#### `VerifyMessage`

The `VerifyMessage` method verifies that a signature is a valid signature of a
message and was created using the secp256k1 private key for an address.

**Request:** `VerifyMessageRequest`

- `string address`: The address to compare against a recovered public key from
  the signature.  Must be secp256k1 P2PK or P2PKH.

- `string message`: The message to verify.

- `bytes signature`: The signature of the message.

**Response:** `VerifyMessageResponse`

- `bool valid`: The signature is valid and was signed by the private key of the
  address.

**Expected errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: The address cannot be decoded or is not secp256k1 P2PK or
  P2PKH.

## `DecodeMessageService`

The `DecodeMessageService` service provides the caller with the ability to
decode various messages and structures given their serialized (binary)
representation.

Unless otherwise noted, all serialized parameters on requests **MUST** belong
to the same network (mainnet/testnet) as the wallet, otherwise the returned
data may contain incorrect information.

**Methods:**

- [`DecodeRawTransaction`](#decoderawtransaction)

### Methods

#### `DecodeRawTransaction`

The `DecodeRawTransaction` method takes a serialized transaction and decodes as
much information as possible.

**Request:** `DecodeRawTransactionRequest`

- `bytes serialized_transaction`: The raw, serialized transaction.

**Response:** `DecodeRawTransactionResponse`

- `DecodedTransaction transaction`: The decoded transaction data.

The `DecodedTransaction` message is documented [here](#decodedtransaction).

**Expected errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: The serialized transaction could not be decoded.

## NetworkService

The `NetworkService` service provides the caller with the ability to query and
perform actions in the P2P network related to blockchain data not necessarily
tracked by the wallet.

In order to use this service, the wallet must have already been loaded. Most
operations fail if the wallet is not connected to an underlying dcrd instance
(when running in regular RPC mode) or to remote peers (when running in SPV mode).

**Methods**

- [`GetRawBlock`](#GetRawBlock)

### Methods

#### `GetRawBlock`

The `GetRawBlock` method queries the network for a full blockchain block. The
returned block is **not** cached by the wallet, therefore callers are advised
to consider the bandwidth implications of requesting a large number of blocks.

**Request:** `GetRawBlockRequest`

- `bytes block_hash`: The hash of the desired block. If unspecified, the block
  is fetched by `block_height`.

- `sint32 block_height` The height of the (mainchain) block to fetch. The wallet
  must have seen this block height for the request to succeed.

**Response:** `GetRawBlockResponse`

- `bytes block`: The serialized raw block.

**Expected errors:**

- `Unavailable`: The wallet is not currently connected to the p2p network.
