# RPC API Specification

Version: 4.38.x

**Note:** This document assumes the reader is familiar with gRPC concepts.
Refer to the [gRPC Concepts documentation](http://www.grpc.io/docs/guides/concepts.html)
for any unfamiliar terms.

**Note:** The naming style used for autogenerated identifiers may differ
depending on the language being used.  This document follows the naming style
used by Google in their Protocol Buffers and gRPC documentation as well as this
project's `.proto` files.  That is, CamelCase is used for services, methods, and
messages, lower_snake_case for message fields, and SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE for
enums.

**Note:** The entierty of the RPC API is currently considered unstable and may
change anytime.  Stability will be gradually added based on correctness,
perceived usefulness and ease-of-use over alternatives, and user feedback.

This document is the authoritative source on the RPC API's definitions and
semantics.  Any divergence from this document is an implementation error.  API
fixes and additions require a version increase according to the rules of
[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](http://semver.org/).

Only optional proto3 message fields are used (the `required` keyword is never
used in the `.proto` file).  If a message field must be set to something other
than the default value, or any other values are invalid, the error must occur in
the application's message handling.  This prevents accidentally introducing
parsing errors if a previously optional field is missing or a new required field
is added.

Functionality is grouped into gRPC services.  Depending on what functions are
currently callable, different services will be running.  As an example, the
server may be running without a loaded wallet, in which case the Wallet service
is not running and the Loader service must be used to create a new or load an
existing wallet.

## `VersionService`

The `VersionService` service provides the caller with versioning information
regarding the RPC server.  It has no dependencies and is always running.

**Methods:**

- [`Version`](#version)

### Methods

#### `Version`

The `Version` method returns the RPC server version.  Versioning follows the
rules of Semantic Versioning (SemVer) 2.0.0.

**Request:** `VersionRequest`

**Response:** `VersionResponse`

- `string version_string`: The version encoded as a string.

- `uint32 major`: The SemVer major version number.

- `uint32 minor`: The SemVer minor version number.

- `uint32 patch`: The SemVer patch version number.

- `string prerelease`: The SemVer pre-release version identifier, if any.

- `string build_metadata`: Extra SemVer build metadata, if any.

**Expected errors:** None

**Stability:** Stable

## `WalletLoaderService`

The `WalletLoaderService` service provides the caller with functions related to
the management of the wallet and its connection to the Decred network.  It has
no dependencies and is always running.

**Methods:**

- [`WalletExists`](#walletexists)
- [`CreateWallet`](#createwallet)
- [`CreateWatchingOnlyWallet`](#createwatchingonlywallet)
- [`OpenWallet`](#openwallet)
- [`CloseWallet`](#closewallet)
- [`StartConsensusRpc`](#startconsensusrpc)
- [`DiscoverAddresses`](#discoveraddresses)
- [`SubscribeToBlockNotifications`](#subscribetoblocknotifications)
- [`FetchHeaders`](#fetchheaders)

**Shared messages:**

- [`BlockDetails`](#blockdetails)
- [`TransactionDetails`](#transactiondetails)
- [`DecodedTransaction`](#decodedtransaction)

### Methods

#### `WalletExists`

The `WalletExists` method returns whether a file at the wallet database's file
path exists.  Clients that must load wallets with this service are expected to
call this RPC to query whether `OpenWallet` should be used to open an existing
wallet, or `CreateWallet` to create a new wallet.

**Request:** `WalletExistsRequest`

**Response:** `WalletExistsResponse`

- `bool exists`: Whether the wallet file exists.

**Expected errors:** None

**Stability:** Unstable

___

#### `CreateWallet`

The `CreateWallet` method is used to create a wallet that is protected by two
levels of encryption: the public passphrase (for data that is made public on the
blockchain) and the private passphrase (for private keys).  Since the seed is
not saved in the wallet database and clients should make their users backup the
seed, it needs to be passed as part of the request.

After creating a wallet, the `WalletService` service begins running.

Since API version 3.0.0, creating the wallet no longer automatically
synchronizes the wallet to the consensus server if it was previously loaded.

**Request:** `CreateWalletRequest`

- `bytes public_passphrase`: The passphrase used for the outer wallet
  encryption.  This passphrase protects data that is made public on the
  blockchain.  If this passphrase has zero length, an insecure default is used
  instead.

- `bytes private_passphrase`: The passphrase used for the inner wallet
  encryption.  This is the passphrase used for data that must always remain
  private, such as private keys.  The length of this field must not be zero.

- `bytes seed`: The BIP0032 seed used to derive all wallet keys.  The length of
  this field must be between 16 and 64 bytes, inclusive.

**Response:** `CreateWalletReponse`

**Expected errors:**

- `FailedPrecondition`: The wallet is currently open.

- `AlreadyExists`: A file already exists at the wallet database file path.

- `InvalidArgument`: A private passphrase was not included in the request, or
  the seed is of incorrect length.

**Stability:** Unstable: There needs to be a way to recover all keys and
  transactions of a wallet being recovered by its seed.  It is unclear whether
  it should be part of this method or a `WalletService` method.

___

#### `CreateWatchingOnlyWallet`

The `CreateWatchingOnlyWallet` method is used to create a watching only wallet.
After creating a wallet, the `WalletService` service begins running.

**Request:** `CreateWatchingOnlyWalletRequest`

- `string extended_public_key`: The extended public key of the wallet.

- `bytes public_passphrase`: The passphrase used for the outer wallet
  encryption.  This passphrase protects data that is made public on the
  blockchain.  If this passphrase has zero length, an insecure default is used
  instead.

**Response:** `CreateWatchingOnlyWalletReponse`

**Expected errors:**

- `FailedPrecondition`: The wallet is currently open.

- `AlreadyExists`: A file already exists at the wallet database file path.

___

#### `OpenWallet`

The `OpenWallet` method is used to open an existing wallet database.  If the
wallet is protected by a public passphrase, it can not be successfully opened if
the public passphrase parameter is missing or incorrect.

After opening a wallet, the `WalletService` service begins running.

Since API version 3.0.0, creating the wallet no longer automatically
synchronizes the wallet to the consensus server if it was previously loaded.

**Request:** `OpenWalletRequest`

- `bytes public_passphrase`: The passphrase used for the outer wallet
  encryption.  This passphrase protects data that is made public on the
  blockchain.  If this passphrase has zero length, an insecure default is used
  instead.

**Response:** `OpenWalletResponse`

**Expected errors:**

- `FailedPrecondition`: The wallet is currently open.

- `NotFound`: The wallet database file does not exist.

- `InvalidArgument`: The public encryption passphrase was missing or incorrect.

**Stability:** Unstable

___

#### `CloseWallet`

The `CloseWallet` method is used to cleanly stop all wallet operations on a
loaded wallet and close the database.  After closing, the `WalletService`
service will remain running but any operations that require the database will be
unusable.

**Request:** `CloseWalletRequest`

**Response:** `CloseWalletResponse`

**Expected errors:**

- `FailedPrecondition`: The wallet is not currently open.

**Stability:** Unstable: It would be preferable to stop the `WalletService`
  after closing, but there does not appear to be any way to do so currently.  It
  may also be a good idea to limit under what conditions a wallet can be closed,
  such as only closing wallets loaded by `WalletLoaderService` and/or using a
  secret to authenticate the operation.

___

#### `StartConsensusRpc`

The `StartConsensusRpc` method is used to provide clients the ability to
dynamically start the dcrd RPC client.  This RPC client is used for wallet
syncing and publishing transactions to the Decred network.

Since API version 3.0.0, starting the consensus server no longer automatically
synchronizes the wallet to the consensus server if it was previously loaded.

**Request:** `StartConsensusRpcRequest`

- `string network_address`: The host/IP and optional port of the RPC server to
  connect to.  IP addresses may be IPv4 or IPv6.  If the port is missing, a
  default port is chosen corresponding to the default dcrd RPC port of the
  active Decred network.

- `string username`: The RPC username required to authenticate to the RPC
  server.

- `bytes password`: The RPC password required to authenticate to the RPC server.

- `bytes certificate`: The consensus RPC server's TLS certificate.  If this
  field has zero length and the network address describes a loopback connection
  (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`) TLS will be disabled.

**Response:** `StartConsensusRpcResponse`

**Expected errors:**

- `FailedPrecondition`: A consensus RPC client is already active.

- `InvalidArgument`: The network address is ill-formatted or does not contain a
  valid IP address.

- `NotFound`: The consensus RPC server is unreachable.  This condition may not
  return `Unavailable` as that refers to `WalletLoaderService` itself being
  unavailable.

- `InvalidArgument`: The username, password, or certificate are invalid.  This
  condition may not be return `Unauthenticated` as that refers to the client not
  having the credentials to call this method.

**Stability:** Unstable: It is unknown if the consensus RPC client will remain
  used after the project gains SPV support.

___

#### `DiscoverAddresses`

The `DiscoverAddresses` method performs BIP0044 address discovery for the wallet
with optional account discovery using the loaded consensus RPC server (required
for querying for known used addresses).  Account discovery requires the wallet
to be unlocked in order to derive account hardened extended pubkeys, and thus
the private passphrase must be passed as a parameter when performing this
action.  Account discovery is typically only required when reseeding a wallet.

**Request:** `DiscoverAddressesRequest`

- `bool discover_accounts`: In addition to syncing addresses for already derived
  accounts, also look ahead for other used accounts.

- `bytes private_passphrase`: The private passphrase to unlock the wallet when
  account discovery is enabled.

**Response:** `DiscoverAddressesResponse`

**Expected Errors:**

- `FailedPrecondition`: The wallet or consensus RPC server has not been opened.

- `InvalidArgument`: A zero length passphrase passphrase was specified when
  account discovery was enabled, or the passphrase was incorrect.

**Stability:** Unstable

___

#### `SubscribeToBlockNotifications`

The `SubscribeToBlockNotifications` method associates the wallet with the
consensus RPC server, subscribes the wallet for attached block and chain switch
notifications, and causes the wallet to process these notifications in the
background.

**Request:** `SubscribeToBlockNotificationsRequest`

**Response:** `SubscribeToBlockNotificationsResponse`

**Expected Errors:**

- `FailedPrecondition`: The wallet or consensus RPC server has not been opened.

**Stability:** Unstable

___

#### `FetchHeaders`

The `FetchHeaders` method fetches main chain block headers from the opened
consensus server client.  The response includes the hash and height of the first
new block added to the main chain, if any.  This is the block that a rescan
should begin at.

**Request:** `FetchHeadersRequest`

**Response:** `FetchHeadersResponse`

- `uint32 fetched_headers_count`: The number of new headers attached to the main
  chain.

- `bytes first_new_block_hash`: The hash of the first new block added to the
  main chain.  Only non-null when `fetched_headers_count` is not zero.

- `int32 first_new_block_height`: The height of the first new block added to the
  main chain.  Only non-zero when `fetched_headers_count` is not zero.

- `bytes main_chain_tip_block_hash`: The hash of the main chain tip block after
  the fetched headers have been applied to the previous tip.

- `int32 main_chain_tip_block_height`: The height of the main chain tip block after
  the fetched headers have been applied to the previous tip.

**Expected errors:**

- `FailedPrecondition`: The wallet or consensus RPC server has not been opened.

**Stability:** Unstable

## `WalletService`

The WalletService service provides RPCs for the wallet itself.  The service
depends on a loaded wallet and does not run when the wallet has not been created
or opened yet.

The service provides the following methods:

- [`Ping`](#ping)

- [`CommittedTickets`](#committedtickets)
- [`BestBlock`](#bestblock)

#### `Ping`

The `Ping` method checks whether the service is active.

**Request:** `PingRequest`

**Response:** `PingResponse`

**Expected errors:** None

**Stability:** Unstable: This may be moved to another service as it does not
  depend on the wallet.

___

#### `Network`

The `Network` method returns the network identifier constant describing the
server's active network.

**Request:** `NetworkRequest`

**Response:** `NetworkResponse`

- `uint32 active_network`: The network identifier.

**Expected errors:** None

**Stability:** Unstable: This may be moved to another service as it does not
  depend on the wallet.

___

#### `AccountNumber`

The `AccountNumber` method looks up a BIP0044 account number by an account's
unique name.

**Request:** `AccountNumberRequest`

- `string account_name`: The name of the account being queried.

**Response:** `AccountNumberResponse`

- `uint32 account_number`: The BIP0044 account number.

**Expected errors:**

- `Aborted`: The wallet database is closed.

- `NotFound`: No accounts exist by the name in the request.

**Stability:** Unstable

___

#### `Accounts`

The `Accounts` method returns the current properties of all accounts managed in
the wallet.

**Request:** `AccountsRequest`

**Response:** `AccountsResponse`

- `repeated Account accounts`: Account properties grouped into `Account` nested
  message types, one per account, ordered by increasing account numbers.

  **Nested message:** `Account`

  - `uint32 account_number`: The BIP0044 account number.

  - `string account_name`: The name of the account.

  - `int64 total_balance`: The total (zero-conf and immature) balance, counted
    in Atoms.

  - `uint32 external_key_count`: The number of derived keys in the external
     key chain.

- `bytes current_block_hash`: The hash of the block wallet is considered to
  be synced with.

- `int32 current_block_height`: The height of the block wallet is considered
  to be synced with.

**Expected errors:**

- `Aborted`: The wallet database is closed.

**Stability:** Unstable

___

#### `Balance`

The `Balance` method queries the wallet for an account's balance.  Balances are
returned as combination of total, spendable (by consensus and request policy),
and unspendable immature coinbase balances.

**Request:** `BalanceRequest`

- `uint32 account_number`: The account number to query.

- `int32 required_confirmations`: The number of confirmations required before an
  unspent transaction output's value is included in the spendable balance.  This
  may not be negative.

**Response:** `BalanceResponse`

- `int64 total`: The total (zero-conf and immature) balance, counted in
  Atoms.

- `int64 spendable`: The spendable balance, given some number of required
  confirmations, counted in Atoms.  This equals the total balance when the
  required number of confirmations is zero and there are no immature coinbase
  outputs.

- `int64 immature_reward`: The total value of all immature coinbase outputs,
  counted in Atoms.

- `int64 immature_stake_generation`: The total value of all immature stakebase outputs,
  or any revocations, counted in Atoms.

- `int64 locked_by_tickets`: The total value of all tickets that are currently locked,
  and awaiting vote.

- `int64 voting_authority`: The total value of all tickets that the account has voting
  authority over.  

- `int64 unconfirmed`: The total value of all unconfirmed transactions with
   with reference to the minimum number of confirmations for a transaction
   (minconf). If minconf is 0 unconfirmed will be 0, otherwise unconfirmed
   will be the total balance of transactions that do fulfill the requested
   minconf.  

**Expected errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: The required number of confirmations is negative.

- `Aborted`: The wallet database is closed.

- `NotFound`: The account does not exist.

**Stability:** Unstable: It may prove useful to modify this RPC to query
  multiple accounts together.

___

#### `BlockInfo`

The `BlockInfo` method queries for info pertaining to blocks that are recorded
by the wallet.  Blocks are queried using either the block hash or height as an
identifier.  Any block currently or previously in the main chain can be queried,
but not all sidechain blocks may be known by the wallet.

**Request:** `BlockInfoRequest`

- `bytes block_hash`: The hash of the block being queried, or null to lookup
  blocks by their height.

- `int32 block_height`: The height of the block being queried.  Height lookup
  only returns results of blocks in the main chain.

**Response:** `BlockInfoResponse`

- `bytes block_hash`: The hash of the queried block.

- `int32 block_height`: The height of the queried block.  This is the height
  recorded in the block header and will be the height in the sidechain for any
  reorged blocks.

- `int32 confirmations`: The number of block confirmations of all transactions
  in the block.  If the block is not currently in the main chain, this field is
  set to zero.

- `int64 timestamp`: The unix timestamp of the block.

- `bytes block_header`: The serialized block header.

- `bool stake_invalidated`: Whether the queried block is in the main chain and
  the next main chain block has stake invalidated the queried block.

- `bool approves_parent`: Whether this block stake validates its parent block.

**Expected errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: The block hash and height were each set to non-default
  values.

- `Aborted`: The wallet database is closed.

- `NotFound`: The block is not recorded by the wallet in the current main chain
  or any old sidechain.

**Stability:** Unstable

___

#### `GetTransaction`

The `GetTransaction` method queries the wallet for a relevant transaction by its
hash.

**Request:** `GetTransactionRequest`

- `bytes transaction_hash`: The hash of the transaction being queried.

**Response:** ` GetTransactionResponse`

- `TransactionDetails transaction`: Wallet details regarding the transaction.

  The `TransactionDetails` message is used by other methods and is documented
  [here](#transactiondetails).

- `int32 confirmations`: The number of block confirmations of the transaction in
  the main chain.  If the transaction was mined in a stake-invalidated block and
  pushed back to mempool to be mined again, or was mined again after being stake
  invalidated, the latest number of confirmations is used (not the confirmations
  of an invalidated block).

- `bytes block_hash`: The block hash the transaction is most recently mined in,
  or null if unmined.

**Expected errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: The transaction hash is of incorrect length.

- `Aborted`: The wallet database is closed.

- `NotFound`: The transaction is not recorded by the wallet.

**Stability:** Unstable

___

#### `GetTransactions`

The `GetTransactions` method queries the wallet for relevant transactions.  The
query set may be specified using a block range, inclusive, with the heights or
hashes of the minimum and maximum block.  Transaction results are grouped
by the block they are mined in, or grouped together with other unmined
transactions.

To avoid exceeding the maximum message size with the return result, a stream is
used to break up the response into several messages.  A single message will have
results of a single block and no unmined transactions, or only unmined
transactions (and no mined transactions).

**Request:** `GetTransactionsRequest`

- `bytes starting_block_hash`: The block hash of the block to begin including
  transactions from.  If this field is set to the default, the
  `starting_block_height` field is used instead.  If changed, the byte array
  must have length 32 and `starting_block_height` must be zero.

- `sint32 starting_block_height`: The block height to begin including
  transactions from.  If this field is non-zero, `starting_block_hash` must be
  set to its default value to avoid ambiguity.  If positive, the field is
  interpreted as a block height.  If negative, the height is subtracted from the
  block wallet considers itself in sync with.

- `bytes ending_block_hash`: The block hash of the last block to include
  transactions from.  If this default is set to the default, the
  `ending_block_height` field is used instead.  If changed, the byte array must
  have length 32 and `ending_block_height` must be zero.

- `int32 ending_block_height`: The block height of the last block to include
  transactions from.  If non-zero, the `ending_block_hash` field must be set to
  its default value to avoid ambiguity.  If both this field and
  `ending_block_hash` are set to their default values, no upper block limit is
  used and transactions through the best block and all unmined transactions are
  included.

- `int32 target_transaction_count`: Try to return at most this amount of
  transactions. Both mined and unmined transactions count towards this limit.
  Note that as transactions are returned on a per-block basis, **more** than
  this amount of transactions may be returned in total, to prevent transactions
  from not being seen. The caller is responsible for further clipping of the
  dataset if it has a hard requirement on the number of total transactions it
  manages.

**Response:** `stream GetTransactionsResponse`

- `BlockDetails mined_transactions`: All mined transactions, organized
  by blocks in the order they appear in the blockchain.

  The `BlockDetails` message is used by other methods and is documented
  [here](#blockdetails).

- `repeated TransactionDetails unmined_transactions`: All unmined transactions.
  The ordering is unspecified.

  The `TransactionDetails` message is used by other methods and is documented
  [here](#transactiondetails).

**Expected errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: A non-default block hash field did not have the correct length.

- `Aborted`: The wallet database is closed.

- `NotFound`: A block, specified by its height or hash, is unknown to the
  wallet.

**Stability:** Unstable

- There is currently no way to get only unmined transactions due to the way
  the block range is specified.

- It would be useful to ignore the block range and return some minimum number of
  the most recent transaction, but it is unclear if that should be added to this
  method's request object, or to make a new method.

- A specified ordering (such as dependency order) for all returned unmined
  transactions would be useful.

___

#### `GetTickets`

The `GetTickets` method queries the wallet for relevant tickets.  The
query set may be specified using a block range, inclusive, with the heights or
hashes of the minimum and maximum block.

To avoid exceeding the maximum message size with the return result, a stream is
used to break up the response into several messages.  A single message will have
results of a single ticket.

**Request:** `GetTicketsRequest`

- `bytes starting_block_hash`: The block hash of the block to begin including
  tickets from.  If this field is set to the default, the
  `starting_block_height` field is used instead.  If changed, the byte array
  must have length 32 and `starting_block_height` must be zero.

- `sint32 starting_block_height`: The block height to begin including
  tickets from.  If this field is non-zero, `starting_block_hash` must be
  set to its default value to avoid ambiguity.  If positive, the field is
  interpreted as a block height.  If negative, the height is subtracted from the
  block wallet considers itself in sync with.

- `bytes ending_block_hash`: The block hash of the last block to include
  tickets from.  If this default is set to the default, the
  `ending_block_height` field is used instead.  If changed, the byte array must
  have length 32 and `ending_block_height` must be zero.

- `int32 ending_block_height`: The block height of the last block to include
  tickets from.  If non-zero, the `ending_block_hash` field must be set to
  its default value to avoid ambiguity.  If both this field and
  `ending_block_hash` are set to their default values, no upper block limit is
  used and transactions through the best block and all unmined transactions are
  included.

- `int32 target_ticket_count`: Try to return at most this amount of tickets.
  Both mined and unmined tickets count towards this limit. Note that the number
  of tickets returned may be higher or lower than this specified target and
  callers are responsible for further clipping of the dataset if required.

**Response:** `stream GetTicketsResponse`

- `TicketDetails tickets`: A given ticket's details.

  **Nested Message** `TicketDetails`

  - `TransactionDetails ticket`: The transaction details of a given ticket.

  - `TransactionDetails spender`: The transaction details of the ticket's
    spender if applicable (otherwise emtpy).

    The `TransactionDetails` message is used by other methods and is documented
    [here](#transactiondetails).

  - `TicketStatus ticket_status`: The observed status of the given ticket.

    **Nested enum:** `TicketStatus`

    - `UNKNOWN`: A ticket whose status was unable to be determined.

    - `UNMINED`: A ticket that has yet to be mined into a block.

    - `IMMATURE`: A ticket that has not yet matured enough to be live.

    - `LIVE`: A currently live ticket that is waiting to be voted.

    - `VOTED`: A ticket that has been voted.

    - `EXPIRED`: A ticket that is expired but not yet revoked.

    - `MISSED`: A ticket that was missed but not yet revoked.

    - `REVOKED`: A ticket that has been revoked.

- `BlockDetails block`: The block the ticket was mined. It is null if the
   ticket hasn't been mined yet.

  **Nested Message** `BlockDetails`

  - `bytes hash`: The binary hash of the block.

  - `int32 height`: The block height.

  - `int64 timestamp`: The timestamp the block was mined.


**Expected errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: A non-default block hash field did not have the correct length.

- `InvalidArgument`: A negative target value was provided.

- `Aborted`: The wallet database is closed.

- `NotFound`: A block, specified by its height or hash, is unknown to the
  wallet.

**Stability:** Unstable

- There is currently no way to get only unmined transactions due to the way
  the block range is specified.

- It would be useful to ignore the block range and return some minimum number of
  the most recent transaction, but it is unclear if that should be added to this
  method's request object, or to make a new method.

- A specified ordering (such as dependency order) for all returned unmined
  transactions would be useful.

___

#### `ChangePassphrase`

The `ChangePassphrase` method requests a change to either the public (outer) or
private (inner) encryption passphrases.

**Request:** `ChangePassphraseRequest`

- `Key key`: The key being changed.

  **Nested enum:** `Key`

  - `PRIVATE`: The request specifies to change the private (inner) encryption
    passphrase.

  - `PUBLIC`: The request specifies to change the public (outer) encryption
    passphrase.

- `bytes old_passphrase`: The current passphrase for the encryption key.  This
  is the value being modified.  If the public passphrase is being modified and
  this value is the default value, an insecure default is used instead.

- `bytes new_passphrase`: The replacement passphrase.  This field may only have
  zero length if the public passphrase is being changed, in which case an
  insecure default will be used instead.

**Response:** `ChangePassphraseResponse`

**Expected errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: A zero length passphrase was specified when changing the
  private passphrase, or the old passphrase was incorrect.

- `Aborted`: The wallet database is closed.

**Stability:** Unstable

___

#### `RenameAccount`

The `RenameAccount` method requests a change to an account's name property.

**Request:** `RenameAccountRequest`

- `uint32 account_number`: The number of the account being modified.

- `string new_name`: The new name for the account.

**Response:** `RenameAccountResponse`

**Expected errors:**

- `Aborted`: The wallet database is closed.

- `InvalidArgument`: The new account name is a reserved name.

- `NotFound`: The account does not exist.

- `AlreadyExists`: An account by the same name already exists.

**Stability:** Unstable

___

#### `Rescan`

The `Rescan` method begins a rescan for all relevant transactions involving all
active addresses and watched outpoints.  Rescans can be time consuming depending
on the amount of data that must be checked, and the size of the blockchain.  If
transactions being scanned for are known to only exist after some height, the
request can specify which block height to begin scanning from.  This RPC returns
a stream of block heights the rescan has completed through.

**Request:** `RescanRequest`

- `int32 begin_height`: The block height to begin the rescan at (inclusive).

**Response:** `stream RescanResponse`

- `int32 rescanned_through`: The block height the rescan has completed through
  (inclusive).

**Expected errors:**

    wallet's settings.

  - `GAP_POLICY_ERROR`: Override any other specified gap policy in the wallet
    settings.  If the gap limit would be violated, return an error.

  - `GAP_POLICY_IGNORE`: Override any other specified gap policy in the wallet
    settings.  Ignore any gap limit violations and return the next child address
    anyways.

#### `FundTransaction`

The `FundTransaction` method queries the wallet for unspent transaction outputs
controlled by some account.  Results may be refined by setting a target output
amount and limiting the required confirmations.  The selection algorithm is
unspecified.

Output results are always created even if a minimum target output amount could
not be reached.  This allows this method to behave similar to the `Balance`
method while also including the outputs that make up that balance.

Change outputs can optionally be returned by this method as well.  This can
provide the caller with everything necessary to construct an unsigned
transaction paying to already known addresses or scripts.

**Request:** `FundTransactionRequest`

- `uint32 account`: Account number containing the keys controlling the output
  set to query.

- `int64 target_amount`: If positive, the service may limit output results to
  those that sum to at least this amount (counted in Atoms).  If zero, all
  outputs not excluded by other arguments are returned.  This may not be
  negative.

    transaction containing this output.

  - `bool from_coinbase`: Whether the output is a coinbase output.

  - `int32 tree`: The tree the output belongs to.  This can take on the values
    `-1` (invalid), `0` (regular), and `1` (stake).

- `int64 total_amount`: The sum of all returned output amounts.  This may be
  less than a positive target amount if there were not enough eligible outputs
  available.

- `bytes change_pk_script`: A transaction output script used to pay the
  remaining amount to a newly-generated change address for the account.  This is
  null if `include_change_script` was false or the target amount was not
  exceeded.

**Expected errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: The target amount is negative.

- `InvalidArgument`: The required confirmations is negative.

- `Aborted`: The wallet database is closed.

- `NotFound`: The account does not exist.

**Stability:** Unstable

___

The `UnspentOutputs` method queries the wallet for unspent transaction outputs
controlled by some account.  Results may be refined by setting a target output
amount and limiting the required confirmations.  The selection algorithm is
unspecified.

not be reached.  This allows this method to behave similar to the `Balance`
method while also including the outputs that make up that balance.

**Request:** `UnspentOutputsRequest`

- `uint32 account`: Account number containing the keys controlling the output
  set to query.

  mempool policy relay fee is used.

- `OutputSelectionAlgorithm output_selection_algorithm`: The algorithm used when
  selecting transaction outputs.

  **Nested enum:** `OutputSelectionAlgorithm`

  - `UNSPECIFIED`: An unspecified selection algorithm is used.  At time of
    writing the wallet only has one selection algorithm but it is not
    optimized for any particular use case.  This will never use the `ALL`
    algorithm, but as other algorithms are introduced, it may become an alias
    for one of them.

  - `ALL`: All spendable outputs from the account are used as inputs

- `repeated Output non_change_outputs`: Non-change outputs to include in the
  transaction.  Outputs are not guaranteed to appear in the same order as they
  are in this repeated field.

  **Nested message:** `Output`

  - `OutputDestination destination`: The output destination (address, script,
    etc.).

  - `int64 amount`: The value created by the output.

  **Nested message**: `OutputDestination`

  - `string address`: Address string to use as the output destination.  If null
    or the empty string, this is skipped and the next destination kind is
    checked.

  - `bytes script`: The script bytes to use in the output script.  Only checked
    if none of the previous destination kinds were set.

  - `uint32 script_version`: When the output destination is a script, this

- `InvalidArgument`: No output destinations (change or non-change) were provided.

- `NotFound`: The account does not exist.

- `ResourceExhausted`: There was not enough available input value to construct
  the transaction.

**Stability:** Unstable

- `InvalidArgument`: The serialized transaction can not be decoded.

**Stability:** Unstable: It is unclear if the request should include an account,
  and only secrets of that account are used when creating input scripts.  It's
  also missing options similar to Core's signrawtransaction, such as the sighash
  flags and additional keys.

  ___

  **Expected errors:**

  - `Aborted`: The wallet database is closed.

  - `InvalidArgument`: A serialized transaction can not be decoded.

  - `InvalidArgument`: The private passphrase is incorrect.
___

___

#### `PublishTransaction`

The `PublishTransaction` method publishes a signed, serialized transaction to
the Decred network.  If the transaction spends any of the wallet's unspent
outputs or creates a new output controlled by the wallet, it is saved by the
wallet and republished later if it or a double spend are not mined.

**Request:** `PublishTransactionRequest`

- `bytes signed_transaction`: The signed transaction to publish.

**Response:** `PublishTransactionResponse`

- `bytes transaction_hash`: The hash of the published transaction.

**Stability:** Unstable

___

#### `PublishUnminedTransactions`

The `PublishTransactions` method re-broadcasts all unmined transactions
to the consensus RPC server so it can be propagated to other nodes
and eventually mined.

**Response:** `PublishUnminedTransactionsResponse`

**Expected errors:**: None

**Stability:** Unstable
___

#### `TicketPrice`

The `TicketPrice` method returns the price of a ticket for the next block, also
known as the stake difficulty. May be incorrect if the daemon is currently
syncing.

**Request:** `TicketPriceRequest`

**Response:** `TicketPriceResponse`

- `int64 ticket_price`: The stake difficulty for the next block.

- `int32 height`: The block height for this query.

**Expected errors:** None

**Stability:** Unstable: The ticket price and height are pulled from separate
daemon passthroughs and may race. Ideally these would be returned from stored
values in the wallet when it updates from incoming stake ticket price
notifications passed from the JSON RPC of dcrd. Right now, wallet block processing
is very slow and it's difficult for these notifications to stay in sync. In the
future, this API may be completely removed in favour of a passthrough for that
set of notifications.

___

#### `StakeInfo`

The `StakeInfo` method returns various statistics about the wallet in relation
to tickets owned fully or completely by the wallet, such as number of tickets
owned and votes cast.

**Expected errors:** None

**Stability:** Unstable

___

#### `PurchaseTickets`

The `PurchaseTickets` method is used to purchase tickets. It can use a specified
address for voting rights, and can additionally be used in conjunction with a
stake pool. An expiration value can be set for the tickets. Expired tickets are
pruned from the wallet and funds and then restored to the user. The following
fields can be left unset, and unset (empty or zero) behaviour is given below:
ticker_address, pool_address, expiry, tx_fee, ticket_fee.

**Request:** `PurchaseTicketsRequest`

- `bytes passphrase`: The wallet's private passphrase.

- `uint32 account`: The account to use to purchase the tickets.

  value in the allowed range of 0.01 to 100.00 to be valid. It must be set when
  the pool_address is also set.

- `uint32 expiry`: The height at which the tickets expire and can no longer enter
  the blockchain. It defaults to 0 (no expiry).

- `int64 tx_fee`: Fees per kB to use for the transaction generating outputs to use
  for buying tickets. If 0 is passed, the global value for a transaction fee
  will be used.

- `int64 ticket_fee`: Fees per kB to use for all purchased tickets. If 0 is
  passed, the global value for a ticket fee will be used.

**Response:** `PurchaseTicketsResponse`

- `repeated bytes ticket_hashes`: The transaction hashes of the generated tickets.

**Expected errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: The private passphrase is incorrect.

- `InvalidArgument`: The spent limit was negative.

- `InvalidArgument`: An invalid number of tickets was specified.

- `InvalidArgument`: An invalid ticket address was specified.

- `InvalidArgument`: An invalid pool address was specified.

- `InvalidArgument`: And invalid pool fees amount was given, either too large or
  small.

- `InvalidArgument`: A negative fees per kB was set.

- `FailedPrecondition`: The wallet balance was not enough to buy tickets.

**Stability:** Unstable: there are a number of current bugs with ticket purchase
and querying for stake difficulty. When the wallet has a more suitable means to
track stake difficulty, and daemon is patched to better handle ticket purchases,
these issues should disappear. They include the stake difficulty changing from the
time it is queried, to the time the ticket is attempted to be purchased, to the
time the ticket hits the daemon mempool and out of date stake difficulties queried
from the daemon.

___

#### `RevokeTickets`

The `RevokeTickets` method creates revocations for any missed or expired tickets
that have not yet been revoked.

**Request:** `RevokeTicketsRequest`

- `bytes passphrase`: The wallet's private passphrase.

**Response:** `RevokeTicketsResponse`

**Expected errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: The private passphrase is incorrect.

**Stability:** Unstable

___

#### `LoadActiveDataFilters`

The `LoadActiveDataFilters` method loads a transaction filter with the
associated consensus RPC server for all active addresses and watched outpoints.

**Request:** `LoadActiveDataFiltersRequest`

**Response:** `LoadActiveDataFiltersResponse`

**Expected errors:**

- `FailedPrecondition`: There is no consensus server associated with the wallet.

#### `TransactionNotifications`

The `TransactionNotifications` method returns a stream of notifications
regarding changes to the blockchain and transactions relevant to the wallet.

**Request:** `TransactionNotificationsRequest`

**Response:** `stream TransactionNotificationsResponse`

- `repeated BlockDetails attached_blocks`: A list of blocks attached to the main
  chain, sorted by increasing height.  All newly mined transactions are included
  in these messages, in the message corresponding to the block that contains
  them.  If this field has zero length, the notification is due to an unmined
  transaction being added to the wallet.

  The `BlockDetails` message is used by other methods and is documented
  [here](#blockdetails).

- `repeated bytes detached_blocks`: The hashes of every block that was
  reorganized out of the main chain.  These are sorted by heights in decreasing
  order (newest blocks first).

- `repeated TransactionDetails unmined_transactions`: All newly added unmined

  `Accounts` method.

___

#### `ConfirmationNotifications`

The `ConfirmationNotifications` method allows notifications of transaction
confirmations.  Transaction hashes to watch are streamed as requests and a
stream of responses is returned which include the number of confirmations of
each watched transaction.  A response is immediately streamed that includes the
current number of confirmations for all newly-watched transactions.  Further
responses will continue to describe the number of confirmations of each
transaction until the confirmation upper limit is met or the transaction is
removed from the wallet (e.g. due to a double spend).

**Request:** `stream ConfirmationNotificationsRequest`

- `repeated bytes tx_hashes`: Hashes of transactions to begin watching.

- `int32 stop_after`: The upper limit on how many confirmations is needed before
  the transaction becomes unwatched.

**Response:** `stream ConfirmationNotificationsResponse`

- `repeated TransactionConfirmations confirmations`: Hashes of watched
  transactions and their current number of confirmations.

  **Nested message:** `TransactionConfirmations`

  - `bytes tx_hash`: The hash of a watched transaction.

  - `int32 confirmations`: The current number of confirmations of the
    transaction.  If the transaction is unknown to the wallet or was removed due
    to a double spend, this value is set to `-1`.

  - `bytes block_hash`: The hash of the block the transaction is mined in, or
    null if unmined.

  - `int32 block_height`: The height of the block the transaction is mined in,
    or `-1` if unmined.

**Expected errors:**

- `InvalidArgument`: A transaction hash did not have the correct length.

- `InvalidArgument`: A negative `stop_after` was specified.

- `Aborted`: The wallet database is closed.

**Stability:** Unstable

___

### Shared messages

The following messages are used by multiple methods.  To avoid unnecessary
duplication, they are documented once here.

#### `BlockDetails`

The `BlockDetails` message is included in responses to report a block and the
wallet's relevant transactions contained therein.

- `bytes hash`: The hash of the block being reported.

- `int32 height`: The height of the block being reported.

- `int64 timestamp`: The Unix time included in the block header.

- `repeated TransactionDetails transactions`: All transactions relevant to the
  wallet that are mined in this block.  Transactions are sorted by their block
  index in increasing order.

  The `TransactionDetails` message is used by other methods and is documented
  [here](#transactiondetails).

- `bool approves_parent`: Whether this block stake validates its parent block.

**Stability**: Unstable: This should probably include the block version.

___

#### `TransactionDetails`

The `TransactionDetails` message is included in responses to report transactions
relevant to the wallet.  The message includes details such as which previous
wallet inputs are spent by this transaction, whether each output is controlled
by the wallet or not, the total fee (if calculable), and the earlist time the
transaction was seen.

- `bytes hash`: The hash of the serialized transaction.

- `bytes transaction`: The serialized transaction.

- `repeated Input debits`: Properties for every previously-unspent wallet output
  spent by this transaction.

  **Nested message:** `Input`

  - `uint32 index`: The transaction input index of the input being reported.

  - `uint32 previous_account`: The account that controlled the now-spent output.

  - `int64 previous_amount`: The previous output value.

- `repeated Output credits`: Properties for every output controlled by the wallet.

  **Nested message:** `Output`

  - `uint32 index`: The transaction output index of the output being reported.

  - `uint32 account`: The account number of the controlled output.

  - `bool internal`: Whether the output pays to an address derived from the
    account's internal key series.  This often means the output is a change
    output.

  - `int64 amount`: The amount for this output.

  - `string address`: The address that the output paid to, if the output script
    can be parsed to a known address type. Otherwise this will be null or the
    empty string.

  - `bytes output_script`: The output script.

- `int64 fee`: The transaction fee, if calculable.  The fee is only calculable
  when every previous output spent by this transaction is also recorded by
  wallet.  Otherwise, this field is zero.

- `int64 timestamp`: The Unix time of the earliest time this transaction was
  seen.

- `TransactionType transaction_type`: The observed type of transaction.

  **Nested enum:** `TransactionType`

  - `REGULAR`: All normal regular tx tree transactions.

  - `TICKET_PURCHASE`: A transaction that purchases a ticket to be consumed later
    by a vote transaction upon random selection, or a recovation if the ticket
    is expired or missed.

  - `VOTE`: A transaction that uses a ticket purchase transaction as an input
    and includes a stake base reward as one of the outputs.

  - `REVOCATION`: A transaction that will free a previously locked utxos in
    a ticket purchase due to expiry or the ticket being missed.  Just as stakebase
    rewards must reach maturity to be used, outputs from an revocation also must
    mature that same amount.

  - `COINBASE`: A coinbase transaction in the regular tx tree.

**Stability**: Unstable: Since the caller is expected to decode the serialized
  transaction, and would have access to every output script, the output
  properties could be changed to only include outputs controlled by the wallet.
